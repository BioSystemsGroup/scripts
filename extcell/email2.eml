Thank you so much for the detailed explanation. I learned a lot today. I wi=
ll take some time to study the java classes later. It is a great way to lea=
rn by practice. =0A=
=0A=
I still have another question, you mentioned 4 grids: sSpace, eSpace, SoD, =
hepSpace. I can understand the last three are endothelial cell space, space=
 of disse and HPC space, but cold you tell me what is "sSpace"? I know the =
analogue still includes a "blood-cell interface", is the "blood-cell interf=
ace" the same with "sSpace"? Thanks.=0A=

A Solute _can_ be in a grid point without being inside a Cell.  But I was w=
rong about how it can happen.  See this code:=0A=
=0A=
https://app.assembla.com/spaces/bsg-ucsf/subversion/source/HEAD/trunks/islj=
/src/isl/model/SSGrid.java#ln367=0A=
=0A=
If, when the SS tries to move a Solute object (through SS.moveMoore()) that=
 already sits inside a Cell, but there's a Cell at the new location that re=
jects that Solute object, then the Solute exits its current Cell, but stays=
 at that grid point.  This can only happen (so far) when a Solute is design=
ated with membraneCrossing=3D=3Dfalse and transportOut=3D=3Dtrue.  Such a S=
olute will leave its Cell and can only move to empty grid points (within th=
e current grid or jumping inward or outward to another grid).=0A=
=0A=
Thanks for asking the question and causing me to re-read the code!  It's al=
ways fun (and good practice) to go through and re-verify how something shou=
ld be coded, especially when several people are working on the same body of=
 code.=0A=

The last part of the question is just what i thought about the "APAP". It i=
s really difficult for me write English like a native speaker.=0A=
