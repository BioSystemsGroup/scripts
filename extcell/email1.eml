(1) Yes, I am using the output fraction combined with an estimate of the si=
zes of all the SSes to arrive at an estimate of the total amount inside all=
 the SSes.=0A=
(2) Yes, I use the SS_size(cylinder volume) to estimate the APAP amount, an=
d the inner_surface_area of the grids to estimate the HPC numbers.  But I c=
alculate the type A and type B SSes separately. =0A=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0A=
(3) I think is is a good way to add an extra class to measure the actual am=
ount of APAP in the SSes. I have no problem in writing java class, but I pr=
obably still need some time to be familiar with the details of our Analog b=
efore I can write a class for our project. =0A=
(4) I agree that the estimate is "rough" and I only considered the Core. =
=0A=
I agree that "Given that each grid point can contain "scale" number of Solu=
te objects, that's a sizeable amount of objects the estimate will miss.  (e=
.g. Type A =3D> 30 circumference * 8 length * 4 grids * (40+18+3) typeA_SSe=
s * 15.5 scale =3D> 907,680 total capacity.)".=0A=
But I have a question here about the grid points. most of the grid points a=
re occupied by the cells, if we calculate the APAP in the grid point, then =
we are calculating the APAP inside the cells, right? It seems that the extr=
a cellular concentration shouldn't consider the APAP inside the cells.=0A=
I am still thinking about the APAP inside the grid points, thank you very m=
uch for your suggestion. =0A=
=0A=
I still have one more question, The "APAP" in the "rxn.csv" file is not a m=
etabolite, but the APAP entering the cell and not metabolized, right?=0A=

Very nice!  If I understand correctly, you're using the output fraction (am=
ount coming out of all the SSes into the CV) combined with an estimate of t=
he sizes of all the SSes to arrive at an estimate of the total amount insid=
e all the SSes.  Is that right?=0A=
=0A=
So, we derive something like:=0A=
=0A=
  output =3D output_fraction * refDose=0A=
  intraLobular_amount =3D output * sum_of_SS_sizes=0A=
=0A=
Then you divide by the number of HPCs to get a intraLobular_amount/HPC.  Is=
 that right?=0A=
=0A=
----------=0A=
=0A=
This is a rough estimate[*] for total Solute objects inside the Lobule.  Bu=
t what I was suggesting was to add a measurement to the analog (new Java cl=
ass in src/isl/measurement/) so that the simulation outputs an actual count=
 of how many Solute objects are inside an SS, but not inside an Hepatocyte.=
=0A=
=0A=
[*] The reason the estimate is "rough" is because this calculation would on=
ly consider the Core (blood flow down the middle of an SS).  The concentric=
 gridded cylinders around the Core will each contain some Solute (4 grids: =
sSpace, eSpace, SoD, hepSpace).  Given that each grid point can contain "sc=
ale" number of Solute objects, that's a sizeable amount of objects the esti=
mate will miss.  (e.g. Type A =3D> 30 circumference * 8 length * 4 grids * =
(40+18+3) typeA_SSes * 15.5 scale =3D> 907,680 total capacity.)=0A=
=0A=
It would be interesting to add that to the estimate.  But the question is: =
Should we add another measure to the code or just go with an estimate like =
this?=0A=
=0A=
p.s. I added a suggestion to the google doc intro.=0A=
